# `Fav`

Fav is a go command line tool to note down your favorite commands and execute them later on. I started this project just as a need and will bring on more features in the future

---

First things to improve will be giving more functionality to the gui which is in alpha phase now

## Why fav?

I couldn't come up with a better name. I had to come up with something short and this was the first best thing that came to mind

## How to use it?

You can always use `fav -h` to see how to use it
